# QRCodeProject
First project using Front End Mentor. I have accepted this challenge and will be giving it my best shot to build the QR Code Component.
This is the start of my upskilling journey as a Front-End Developer. I found the Front End mentor site through Kevn Powells YouTube channel. 

In this challenge I will be building a QR Code component as per the jpegs and style guide given in the challenge folders.

Lets go!
